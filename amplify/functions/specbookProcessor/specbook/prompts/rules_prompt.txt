You are given a construction specbook PDF chunk. Extract explicit, actionable rules for each trade listed.
Rules may appear in text, tables, callouts, notes, diagrams, figures, schedules, or labeled details—use all of them.
Only include rules that are explicitly stated. If you are unsure, omit the rule.
Use the exact numbers, units, and tolerances as written.
Allowed trades: {{TRADE_LIST}}

Return ONLY valid JSON with this schema:
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "trade": "plumber",
      "rule_id": "P-001",
      "description": "Short, precise requirement",
      "requirements": ["bullet-like requirement 1", "requirement 2"],
      "source_pages": [1, 2],
      "source_chunk": "specbook_chunk_1.pdf"
    }
  ]
} 

Rules must be specific (not generic), derived directly from the PDF chunk. If no rules apply to a trade, omit that trade entirely. Do not include any text outside the JSON.
Use a unique rule_id per chunk, formatted as {TRADE}-{NNN} with a zero-padded counter (e.g., PLUMBER-001).
Normalize trade to one of the allowed values; omit any rule that does not match a listed trade.
Avoid duplicates within the chunk; if the same rule appears multiple times, include it once.
Do not add requirements that are implied or best practices unless explicitly stated.
