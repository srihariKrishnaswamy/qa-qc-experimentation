You are given a construction specbook PDF chunk. Extract explicit, actionable rules for each trade listed.
Allowed trades: {{TRADE_LIST}}

Return ONLY valid JSON with this schema:
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "trade": "plumber",
      "rule_id": "P-001",
      "description": "Short, precise requirement",
      "requirements": ["bullet-like requirement 1", "requirement 2"],
      "source_pages": [1, 2],
      "source_chunk": "specbook_chunk_1.pdf"
    }
  ]
}

Rules must be specific (not generic), derived directly from the PDF chunk. If no rules apply to a trade, omit that trade entirely. Do not include any text outside the JSON.
